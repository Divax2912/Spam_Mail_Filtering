# Spam Mail Filtering using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a spam mail filter using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content and features extracted from them.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Collected a .csv file from the kaggle  website .
- **Feature Engineering**: Explanation of the features extracted from the emails that are TF-IDF Vectorization: "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) assigns weights to terms based on their frequency in a document (email) relative to their frequency across all documents. This helps in capturing the importance of terms specific to each email".
- **Model Selection**: The models used here are logistic regression.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics used to evaluate the model's performance here is Accuracy.
